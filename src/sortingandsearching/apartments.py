"""
There are n applicants and m free apartments.
Your task is to distribute the apartments so that as many applicants as possible will get an apartment.
Each applicant has a desired apartment size,
and they will accept any apartment whose size is close enough to the desired size.

Input
The first input line has three integers n, m, and k:
the number of applicants, the number of apartments, and the maximum allowed difference.
The next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an:
the desired apartment size of each applicant.
If the desired size of an applicant is x, he or she will accept any apartment whose size is between x−k and x+k.
The last line contains m integers b1,b2,…,bm: the size of each apartment.

Output
Print one integer: the number of applicants who will get an apartment.

Constraints
1 <= n,m <= 2⋅10^5
0 <= k <= 10^9
1 <= ai,bi <= 10^9

Example
Input:
4 3 5
60 45 80 60
30 60 75
Output:
2
