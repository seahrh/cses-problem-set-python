"""
You are given a DNA sequence: a string consisting of characters A, C, G, and T.
Find the longest repetition in the sequence. This is a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character.
Input
The only input line contains a string of n characters.
Output
Print one integer: the length of the longest repetition.
Constraints
1â‰¤nâ‰¤10^6
Example
Input:
ATTCGGGA
Output:
3

SOLUTION
Time O(N)
Space O(1)
